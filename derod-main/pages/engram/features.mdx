# Engram Features

Engram combines privacy, security, and usability features to create a comprehensive platform for accessing decentralized applications on the DERO blockchain. The platform is designed to protect user data while providing a seamless experience for both users and developers.

## Privacy-First Design

Privacy is a foundational principle of Engram's architecture. The platform operates without any tracking or telemetry systems, ensuring that no user data or usage metrics are collected. All application code runs locally without remote dependencies, eliminating potential data leakage through network connections.

Engram connects directly to the DERO blockchain network, bypassing intermediary servers that could monitor or manipulate traffic. For applications that need access to sensitive information, Engram implements granular permission controls that give users complete authority over what data each application can access.

## Enhanced Security

Security in Engram is implemented through multiple protective layers. Applications run in sandboxed execution environments that isolate them from your system, preventing unauthorized access to local resources. Before execution, all application code is verified against blockchain records to ensure integrity.

The platform uses a permission-based access model where applications must request explicit authorization for sensitive operations. This puts users in control of their security boundaries. Additionally, any local data stored by applications is encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

  Applications in Engram operate in isolated contexts with explicit permission requirements, significantly reducing security risks compared to traditional web applications.

## User Interface

Engram features a clean, modern interface designed for intuitive navigation. The UI includes dedicated sections for application discovery, where users can browse and search for available dApps on the DERO blockchain.

To improve efficiency, the platform maintains lists of favorites and recently accessed applications. The responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes, optimizing the experience across desktop and laptop configurations.

## Technical Capabilities

### TELA Integration

As a compliant host application for TELA content, Engram includes comprehensive support for the TELA framework:

* TELA-INDEX-1 parser for loading applications deployed via the TELA standard
* TELA-DOC-1 renderer for displaying application code from multiple contracts
* Efficient application caching to improve performance
* Support for shared libraries across multiple applications

### Wallet Connectivity

Engram connects to DERO wallets through the XSWD protocol, enabling:

* Secure, encrypted communication with your wallet
* Transaction signing requests with clear authorization prompts
* Balance checking directly within applications
* Support for multiple addresses across different applications

### Developer Tools

For application developers, Engram provides a suite of tools to streamline development:

* Debugging utilities for troubleshooting application behavior
* Local testing environment for pre-deployment verification
* Network inspection tools to monitor blockchain interactions
* Console access for viewing application logs and messages

## Additional Features

### Application Management

Engram includes robust application management tools that allow users to:

* Update applications to the latest versions or roll back to previous versions if needed
* View and contribute to community ratings for applications
* Monitor and manage application permissions through a centralized dashboard

### Offline Support

The platform functions even with intermittent connectivity through:

* Offline mode for accessing previously loaded applications
* Background synchronization when connectivity is restored
* Caching of content to reduce dependency on constant blockchain connectivity

### Customization Options

Users can personalize their experience with:

* Theme selection between light and dark modes
* Layout configuration to match workflow preferences
* Connection settings for optimizing network performance
* Default application assignments for specific functions

These features combine to make Engram a powerful yet user-friendly platform for the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications on DERO.
