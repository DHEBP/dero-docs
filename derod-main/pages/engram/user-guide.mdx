# Engram User Guide

This guide will help you navigate and use Engram effectively to access decentralized applications on the DERO blockchain.

## Getting Started

After [downloading Engram from GitHub](https://github.com/DEROFDN/Engram/releases), launch the application from your desktop or applications folder.

## Connecting to a DERO Node

Before using any applications, you'll need to connect to a DERO node:

<Tabs items={['Local Node', 'Remote Node', 'Public Node']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    If you're running a local DERO node:
    
    1. Go to **Settings** > **Node Configuration**
    2. Select **Local Node**
    3. Enter `127.0.0.1:10102` for mainnet or `127.0.0.1:40402` for testnet
    4. Click **Connect**
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    To connect to your own remote node:
    
    1. Go to **Settings** > **Node Configuration**
    2. Select **Remote Node**
    3. Enter the node address and port
    4. Provide authentication details if required
    5. Click **Connect**
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    To use a predefined public node:
    
    1. Go to **Settings** > **Node Configuration**
    2. Select **Public Node**
    3. Choose a node from the dropdown list
    4. Click **Connect**
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      Using public nodes may reduce privacy. For maximum privacy, consider running your own node.
    </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Connecting Your Wallet

To interact with dApps that require wallet functionality:

1. Go to **Wallet** > **Connect Wallet**
