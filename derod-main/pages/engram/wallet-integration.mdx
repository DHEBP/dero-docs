# Wallet Integration with Engram

Connecting your DERO wallet to Engram allows you to interact with decentralized applications that require blockchain transactions. This guide explains the integration process and available options.

## Understanding XSWD Protocol

Engram uses the XSWD (Cross-Site WebSocket DERO) protocol for secure wallet communication:

<Callout type="info">
  **Learn About XSWD**: This guide uses the [XSWD protocol](/tools/xswd) for wallet communication. See the protocol page for technical details and how XSWD provides secure, permissioned access to your wallet.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  XSWD enables permissioned web socket interactions between applications and DERO wallets, allowing for secure transactions while maintaining control over your funds.
</Callout>

The protocol provides several key benefits:

- **Secure connection**: All communication is encrypted
- **Permissioned access**: You control what applications can do
- **No private key exposure**: Your wallet's private keys never leave your wallet
- **Transaction verification**: All transactions require explicit approval

## Compatible Wallets

Engram works with wallets that support the XSWD protocol:

- [DERO WebSocket Wallet](https://github.com/DEROFDN/xswd)
- [Engram Wallet](https://github.com/DEROFDN/Engram-Wallet)
- [Other third-party wallets with XSWD support]

## Connection Methods

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Connecting via XSWD (Recommended)
    
    This is the preferred method for connecting your wallet to Engram:
    
    1. Ensure your XSWD-compatible wallet is running
    2. In Engram, go to **Wallet** > **Connect Wallet**
    3. Select **XSWD Connection**
    4. Engram will automatically detect available wallets
    5. Select your wallet from the list
    6. Approve the connection request in your wallet
    7. You'll see a confirmation message in Engram when connected
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Manual Connection
    
    If automatic detection doesn't work, you can manually connect:
    
    1. In your wallet, find your XSWD connection details (typically in settings)
    2. Note the connection address (usually `127.0.0.1:PORT`)
    3. In Engram, go to **Wallet** > **Connect Wallet**
    4. Select **Manual Connection**
    5. Enter the connection address
    6. Click **Connect**
    7. Approve the connection request in your wallet
    8. You'll see a confirmation message when connected
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Wallet Permissions

When connecting your wallet, Engram will request certain permissions:

### Basic Permissions

- **View Balance**: See your DERO balance
- **View Addresses**: Access your wallet addresses
- **Network Information**: See blockchain status

### Extended Permissions (Optional)

- **Create Transactions**: Generate unsigned transactions
- **Sign Transactions**: Authorize and sign transactions
- **Deploy Smart Contracts**: Create new contracts on the blockchain

<Callout type="warning">
  Always review permission requests carefully. Only grant permissions that you're comfortable with.
</Callout>

## Managing Wallet Connections

### Viewing Connection Status

To check your wallet connection status:

1. Look for the wallet icon in the status bar
   - Green: Connected and ready
   - Yellow: Connected with limited permissions
   - Red: Not connected or connection issues
2. Hover over the icon for more details

### Disconnecting Your Wallet

To disconnect your wallet from Engram:

1. Go to **Wallet** > **Disconnect Wallet**
2. Confirm the disconnection
3. The wallet status icon will update to show you're disconnected

### Changing Connected Wallet

To switch to a different wallet:

1. First disconnect your current wallet
2. Go to **Wallet** > **Connect Wallet**
3. Select the new wallet to connect
4. Follow the standard connection process

## Using Your Wallet with dApps

### Transaction Approval

When using a dApp that requires blockchain transactions:

1. The application will create a transaction request
2. Engram will forward this request to your connected wallet
3. Your wallet will display the transaction details for review
4. Review the details carefully before approving
5. Approve or reject the transaction in your wallet
6. The result will be sent back to the application

### Viewing Transaction History

To see your transaction history:

1. Go to **Wallet** > **Transaction History**
2. View a list of all transactions made through Engram
3. Click on any transaction for more details
4. Filter transactions by application, type, or status

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices

Follow these security best practices when connecting your wallet:

- **Verify applications**: Only connect to trusted dApps
- **Check transaction details**: Always review transactions before approval
- **Use session timeouts**: Configure your wallet to disconnect after inactivity
- **Separate wallets**: Consider using different wallets for different purposes
- **Regular updates**: Keep both Engram and your wallet software updated

### Privacy Settings

Enhance your privacy with these settings:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy**
2. Enable **Request Confirmation for All Transactions**
3. Configure **Wallet Connection Timeout**
4. Set **Default Permission Level** to your preference

## Troubleshooting Wallet Connections

### Common Issues

#### Wallet Not Detected

If Engram doesn't detect your wallet:

1. Ensure your wallet is running and unlocked
2. Verify the wallet supports XSWD protocol
3. Check that no firewall is blocking communication
4. Try the manual connection method

#### Connection Timeouts

If the connection times out:

1. Verify your wallet is still running
2. Check network settings on both applications
3. Restart both Engram and your wallet
4. Try using a different port for connection

#### Transaction Failures

If transactions fail:

1. Check your wallet has sufficient balance
2. Verify your network connection is stable
3. Ensure your wallet is properly synchronized with the blockchain
4. Try creating a simple test transaction

## Advanced Wallet Features

### Multi-Wallet Support

Engram supports connecting multiple wallets simultaneously:

1. Go to **Wallet** > **Manage Wallets**
2. Click **Add Wallet**
3. Follow the connection process for each wallet
4. Choose which wallet to use for each application

### Hardware Wallet Integration

For hardware wallet users:

1. Connect your hardware wallet to your computer
2. Use an XSWD-compatible wallet as a bridge
3. Connect the bridge wallet to Engram
4. Transactions will be forwarded to your hardware wallet for approval
