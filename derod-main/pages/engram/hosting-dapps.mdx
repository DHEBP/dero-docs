# Hosting and Discovering dApps with Engram

Engram serves as a gateway to decentralized applications (dApps) built on the DERO blockchain. This guide explains how to discover, browse, and interact with these applications.

## Understanding DERO dApps

Decentralized applications on DERO have several unique characteristics:

- **On-chain storage**: Application code is stored directly on the blockchain
- **Local execution**: Applications run in your local environment, not on remote servers
- **Privacy-preserving**: Built on DERO's private blockchain technology
- **TELA standard**: Follow the TELA decentralized web standard for consistency

<Callout type="info">
  All dApps available through Engram are built using the TELA standard, ensuring a consistent and secure user experience.
</Callout>

## Discovering Applications

Engram provides multiple ways to discover dApps:

### Manual SCID Entry

If you know the SCID (Smart Contract ID) of an application:

1. Click **Apps** > **Add by SCID**
2. Enter the SCID in the provided field
3. Click **Load Application**
4. Review the application information
5. Click **Add to Library** to save it

## Application Details

Each application listing includes important information:

- **Name and Description**: What the application does
- **Developer**: Who created the application
- **Rating**: Community feedback on quality
- **Last Updated**: When the application was last modified
- **Version**: Current application version
- **Permissions**: What the application can access

## Managing Your Application Library

### Adding Applications

To add an application to your library:

1. Find the application in the directory
2. Click the **Add to Library** button
3. Review and approve any required permissions
4. The application will appear in your personal library

### Organizing Applications

Keep your library organized with these features:

- **Favorites**: Star applications for quick access
- **Categories**: Create custom categories for organization
- **Search**: Quickly find applications by name or function
- **Sort options**: Arrange by name, date added, or frequency of use

## Using Applications

### Launching Applications

To launch an application:

1. Find the application in your library
2. Click the application tile or the **Launch** button
3. The application will load in the main Engram window
4. Wait for initialization to complete

### Application Permissions

Applications may request certain permissions:

- **Wallet Access**: Connecting to your DERO wallet
- **Storage**: Saving data locally
- **Network**: Connecting to external resources
- **Notifications**: Sending you alerts

<Callout type="warning">
  Always review permission requests carefully. Only grant permissions that are necessary for the application's functionality.
</Callout>

## Creating Your Own dApps

If you're interested in developing applications for Engram:

1. Learn the TELA standard for decentralized web applications
2. Develop your application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
3. Deploy your application on the DERO blockchain
4. Share your application's SCID for others to discover

For detailed development instructions, see the [Developer API](/engram/developer-api) documentation.

## Application Ratings and Reviews

### Rating System

Engram uses a community-based rating system:

- **Ratings**: Applications can be rated from 0-99
- **First digit**: Represents overall quality category (0-9)
- **Second digit**: Provides specific details about the rating (0-9)

For example:
- 80: Very good
- 77: Good, Works well
- 43: Should be improved, Bugs
- 7: Do not use, Corrupted

### Submitting Ratings

To rate an application:

1. Launch the application in Engram
2. Click the **Rate** button in the application menu
3. Choose your rating value
4. Optionally add a comment
5. Submit your rating

<Callout type="info">
  Each DERO address can submit one rating per application. You can update your rating at any time.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

When using dApps, keep these security practices in mind:

- **Verify applications**: Check community ratings and reviews
- **Review permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Check SCIDs**: Verify application SCIDs match official sources
- **Use separate wallets**: Consider using different wallets for different applications
- **Report issues**: Submit feedback for suspicious applications

## Offline Access

Engram allows you to access applications even when offline:

1. Applications are cached locally after first use
2. Launch Engram even without internet connectivity
3. Previously used applications will be available
4. Blockchain interactions will resume when connectivity is restored

## Future of DERO dApps

The DERO dApp ecosystem is continuously evolving:

- **Growing library**: New applications are regularly added
- **Enhanced functionality**: Existing applications are improved over time
- **Developer tools**: Better development resources are being created
- **Community involvement**: User feedback shapes the ecosystem

Stay updated by regularly checking the Engram application directory for new additions and updates.
