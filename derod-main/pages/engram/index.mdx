# What is Engram?
![What is a Engram](/assets/engram_header.png)

Engram is a desktop application that serves as a gateway to decentralized applications (dApps) on the DERO blockchain. It provides a secure, privacy-focused environment where users can browse and interact with applications whose code and data reside entirely on the blockchain through smart contracts. Unlike traditional browsers that connect to centralized servers, Engram communicates directly with the DERO network, significantly enhancing user privacy and security.

As a compliant host application for TELA content, Engram retrieves application code from the blockchain, verifies its integrity, and executes it in a sandboxed environment. This approach eliminates reliance on centralized infrastructure and protects users from potential surveillance or tampering.

## Key Benefits

Engram offers several advantages over traditional application platforms:

**Privacy Protection**: Engram doesn't collect user data or include tracking mechanisms. All interactions occur directly with the blockchain, preventing surveillance by third parties.

**Enhanced Security**: Applications run in sandboxed environments with strict permission controls. Code verification ensures applications match their on-chain records, protecting users from malicious modifications.

**User-Friendly Interface**: The platform features an intuitive design that simplifies interaction with blockchain applications. Users can easily discover, browse, and use dApps through a clean, familiar interface.

**Developer Support**: Engram provides a standardized environment for dApp developers with consistent runtime behavior, local testing tools, and specialized APIs for blockchain interaction.

## Use Cases

Engram supports a wide range of decentralized applications:

* Privacy-focused social applications for messaging and networking
* Financial tools for asset management and token exchanges
* Digital ownership platforms for NFTs and collectibles
* On-chain games with provable fairness mechanisms
* Collaborative tools for document sharing and version control
* Educational content with permanent, tamper-proof storage

## Relationship with TELA

TELA and Engram work together to deliver a complete decentralized application ecosystem. TELA provides the framework for deploying applications to the blockchain, while Engram serves as the interface through which users access these applications. This partnership establishes common standards for application structure and behavior while keeping all code and data on-chain.

The combination creates a truly decentralized application experience where neither the application code nor the platform accessing it relies on centralized infrastructure, maximizing both security and privacy for users.
