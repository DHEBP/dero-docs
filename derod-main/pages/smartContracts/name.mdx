## Nameservice

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Testnet Tutorial:** This guide uses testnet ports (40402/40403). Always test smart contracts on testnet before deploying to mainnet. For mainnet, use ports **10102** (daemon) and **10103** (wallet).
</Callout>

Register and associate a DERO wallet with a username using the Nameservice. It includes instructions for checking the availability of a username and the process to register it with the associated DERO wallet using specific cURL commands.

### Step 1
Check whether the username is already registered. You cannot register the username if it's already taken.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:40402/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"nametoaddress","params":{"name":"TESTUSERNAME" }}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Step 2
Register and associate a DERO wallet with the username.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"scinvoke","params":{"scid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","ringsize":2, "sc_rpc":[{"name":"entrypoint","datatype":"S","value":"Register"}, {"name":"name","datatype":"S","value":"TESTUSERNAME" }] }}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Note:**

- Replace "TESTUSERNAME" with your desired available username in the above steps.
- `"scid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"` is reserved for nameservice registration.
