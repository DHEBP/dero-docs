# What are Bulletproofs?
![Rocket Bulletproofs](/assets/bulletproofs.jpeg)

Bulletproofs serve as cryptographic tools that offer a way to verify the existence of information without revealing the actual content. For instance, they can ascertain that a number falls within a certain range while keeping the specifics of that number private. Unlike zk-SNARKs, which demand a trusted setup, Bulletproofs enable trustless verification, enhancing privacy within transactions.

The primary function of Bulletproofs extends beyond enabling confidential transactions; they also significantly reduce the size of verification proofs, often condensing them to around 10% of their original size. This reduction not only ensures smaller transactions but also reinforces privacy measures.

## DERO Rocket Bulletproofs

Introduced in June 2018, DERO made a pioneering move by deploying Rocket Bulletproofs on its mainnet, marking a significant milestone as one of the first cryptocurrencies to adopt this advancement. DERO's Bulletproofs were crafted from the ground up, not borrowed or adapted from any existing public implementations. This independent development resulted in a highly optimized implementation with **exceptional performance** - approximately 10X faster than typical bulletproof implementations.

DERO's Rocket Bulletproofs were built specifically for DERO's unique architecture, showcasing custom cryptographic engineering. These bulletproofs are celebrated for their exceptional speed, robust security, and scalability, setting a high bar for privacy technology performance.
