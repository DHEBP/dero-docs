# TELA Security Model

<Callout type="success" emoji="üîí">
**Zero-Trust Architecture:** TELA applications run on-chain with cryptographic verification. No servers to compromise, no code injection, no hidden changes.
</Callout>

## How TELA Security Works

```mermaid
graph TB
    DEV[Developer] -->|1. Deploy| BC[DERO Blockchain]
    BC -->|2. Immutable Storage| DOC[TELA-DOC-1<br/>Code Locked]
    BC -->|3. Metadata| IDX[TELA-INDEX-1<br/>Updateable]
    
    USER[User] -->|4. Request| ENG[Engram<br/>Local Browser]
    ENG -->|5. Fetch & Verify| BC
    BC -->|6. Cryptographic Proof| ENG
    ENG -->|7. Execute Locally| APP[TELA App<br/>Sandboxed]
    
    APP -.No Server!.-> X[‚ùå]
    APP -.No Backend!.-> X
    APP -.No Database!.-> X
```

**Result:** Applications are verifiable, immutable, and censorship-resistant.

## TELA vs Traditional Web Security

| Security Layer | Traditional Web | TELA |
|----------------|-----------------|------|
| **Code Storage** | üëÅÔ∏è Server (can change anytime) | üîí Blockchain (immutable) |
| **Code Integrity** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Trust the server | ‚úÖ Cryptographically verified |
| **Execution** | üåê Remote server | üíª Local (your computer) |
| **Backend** | üîì Centralized database | üîê Smart contracts |
| **Updates** | ‚ùå Silent, undetectable | ‚úÖ Transparent on-chain |
| **Censorship** | ‚ùå Can be taken down | ‚úÖ Unstoppable |
| **Privacy** | üëÅÔ∏è Server logs everything | üîí Local execution |

## 5 Security Layers

### üîê **Layer 1: Blockchain Immutability**

**Once deployed ‚Üí Forever locked**

```mermaid
graph LR
    D[Developer] -->|Deploy| BC[Blockchain]
    BC -->|Permanent| LOCK[üîí Locked Forever]
    
    HACKER[Hacker] -.Cannot Change.-> BC
    SERVER[No Server] -.Cannot Hack.-> BC
    GOV[Censorship] -.Cannot Remove.-> BC
```

**What this means:**
- ‚úÖ Code cannot be modified after deployment
- ‚úÖ No server-side code injection
- ‚úÖ Historical record of all versions
- ‚úÖ Prevents malicious updates

---

### üîë **Layer 2: Cryptographic Verification**

**Every file has a mathematical proof**

| What Gets Verified | How |
|-------------------|-----|
| **File Integrity** | SHA-256 hash on blockchain |
| **Author Identity** | DERO wallet address (cryptographic signature) |
| **Contract Linkage** | Cryptographic references between DOC-1 and INDEX-1 |
| **Code Authenticity** | Blockchain consensus (51% attack required to forge) |

**Verification process:**
```
1. User requests app
2. Engram fetches code from blockchain
3. Calculates hash of downloaded code
4. Compares to hash in INDEX-1 contract
5. ‚úÖ Match = authentic | ‚ùå Mismatch = reject
```

---

### üíª **Layer 3: Local Execution**

**Code runs on YOUR computer, not a server**

**Attack Vectors Eliminated:**
- ‚ùå Server-side attacks (no server!)
- ‚ùå Database breaches (no database!)
- ‚ùå Man-in-the-middle (cryptographically verified)
- ‚ùå Session hijacking (no sessions!)
- ‚ùå Server logging (runs locally)

**Modern Browser Protection:**
- ‚úÖ Sandboxed execution
- ‚úÖ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ‚úÖ Same-origin policy
- ‚úÖ Memory isolation

---

### üì¶ **Layer 4: Dual-Contract Architecture**

**Separation of code and metadata**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "TELA-DOC-1 (Immutable)"
        CODE[Application Code<br/>HTML, CSS, JS]
        LOCKED[üîí Cannot Change<br/>Hash-Verified]
    end
    
    subgraph "TELA-INDEX-1 (Updateable)"
        META[Metadata<br/>Name, Icon, Version]
        REFS[References to DOC-1]
        UPDATE[‚úÖ Can Update<br/>Points to new DOC-1]
    end
    
    DOC -->|Contains| CODE
    CODE -->|Verified by| LOCKED
    
    IDX -->|Contains| META
    IDX -->|Points to| DOC
    META -->|Allows| UPDATE
```

**Why this is secure:**
- ‚úÖ Code (DOC-1) is immutable = can't inject malware
- ‚úÖ Metadata (INDEX-1) is updateable = app can improve
- ‚úÖ User can verify which DOC-1 version they're running
- ‚úÖ Transparency: All changes visible on-chain

---

### üåê **Layer 5: Decentralized Trust**

| Trust Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Author Accountability** | Wallet address = permanent identity on-chain |
| **Community Ratings** | Users rate apps (stored on-chain) |
| **Transparency** | All code visible = community audit |
| **No Gatekeepers** | Anyone can deploy, users decide trust |
| **Reputation** | Author's history = visible on blockchain |

---

## Security Best Practices

### üë®‚Äçüíª **For Developers**

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Validate ALL inputs** | Prevent XSS and injection attacks |
| **Verify 3rd-party libraries** | External code = potential vulnerability |
| **Minimize dependencies** | Smaller attack surface |
| **Test thoroughly** | Use TELA-CLI for security testing |
| **Document permissions** | Be transparent about what your app needs |
| **Version your DOC-1s** | Users can choose which version to trust |

<Callout type="warning">
**Remember:** Your code is IMMUTABLE and PUBLIC. Test carefully before deploying!
</Callout>

---

### üë§ **For Users**

| Practice | How To |
|----------|--------|
| **Check author address** | Look up author's other apps on blockchain |
| **Read community ratings** | See what others say about the app |
| **Review permissions** | Understand what access you're granting |
| **Keep Engram updated** | Latest security patches |
| **Start with low-risk apps** | Test with documents/games before financial apps |

**Red Flags:**
- üö® App requests unnecessary permissions
- üö® Unknown author with no history
- üö® Poor community ratings
- üö® Requests private keys (NEVER legitimate!)

## The Bottom Line

**TELA's Multi-Layer Defense:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    APP[TELA Application]
    
    APP --> L1[üîê Blockchain Immutability]
    APP --> L2[üîë Cryptographic Verification]
    APP --> L3[üíª Local Execution]
    APP --> L4[üì¶ Dual-Contract Design]
    APP --> L5[üåê Community Trust]
    
    L1 --> SEC[üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive<br/>Security]
    L2 --> SEC
    L3 --> SEC
    L4 --> SEC
    L5 --> SEC
```

**TELA Security = Multiple independent layers**

If one layer is bypassed, others remain protective. This defense-in-depth approach makes TELA significantly more secure than traditional web applications.

## Comparison: TELA vs Web2

**Traditional Web:**
```
Trust the company ‚Üí Trust the server ‚Üí Hope they're secure
```

**TELA:**
```
Verify on blockchain ‚Üí Run locally ‚Üí You control security
```

**Difference:** TELA removes trust requirements through cryptographic proof and decentralization.
